# Ames Housing Price Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa using the Ames Housing dataset. The model is built using ElasticNet regression and includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of houses based on various features such as quality, size, location, and amenities. The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loading the dataset and exploring its basic properties
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying features that correlate most strongly with sale prices
3. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Identifying and removing anomalous data points
4. **Missing Value Treatment**: Employing various strategies to handle missing values based on the context
5. **Feature Engineering**: Converting categorical variables to numerical representations
6. **Model Training**: Building an ElasticNet regression model with hyperparameter tuning
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Ames Housing dataset, which contains information on residential properties in Ames, Iowa, including:

- Property characteristics (e.g., area, rooms, quality)
- Location information
- Building details (e.g., construction materials, age)
- Sale information

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Removing outliers (houses with high quality but low prices, and houses with large living areas but low prices)
- Handling missing values based on the nature of each feature
- Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding

### Modeling
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- ElasticNet regression model
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
- Parameters tuned: alpha and l1_ratio

### Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Model Error (percentage)

## Results

The final model achieves good predictive performance with optimized hyperparameters. The specific error metrics are calculated in the notebook.

## Future Work

Potential improvements for this project:
- Exploring additional feature engineering approaches
- Testing different regression algorithms
- Implementing ensemble methods
- Fine-tuning model parameters further
